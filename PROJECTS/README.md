# PROJECT 1 
Exploring the use of logistic regression for image classification.

## Part One - Logistic Regression for Digit Classification
- Given data corresponding to images of hand- written digits (8 and 9 in particular). 
- Data has been split into various training, and testing sets; each set is given in CSV form, and is divided into inputs (x) and outputs (y).
- Each row of the input data consists of pixel data from a (28 Ã— 28) image with gray-scale values between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white)
- Pixel data is represented as a single feature-vector of length 282 = 784 such values. 
- The output data is a binary label, with 0 representing an 8, and 1 representing a 9.
- Tasked to explore Logistic Regression Models, Accuracy, Logistic Loss, Regularization Parameters

## Part Two - Trousers vs. Dresses
- Similar to Part Two but more abstract
- Explore and apply feature transformations and regularization penalties of own choice to create optimal model solution

# PROJECT 2 
NLP: Explore a variety of classifiers, applied to a real-world data-set for natural language processing. In each case, explored and analyzed a range of model hyperparameters.

- Supplied with several thousand single-sentence reviews, collected from three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com. 
- Each review consists of a sentence, and has been assigned a binary label indicating the sentiment (1 for positive and 0 for negative) of that sentence. 
- Goal is to develop binary classifiers that can generate the sentiment-labels for new sentences, automating the assessment process. 
- Reviews may contain slang, spelling errors, foreign characters.
